# Intro to REST

## Objectives

1. Define the RESTful URL conventions
2. Identify seven RESTful URLs and HTTP verbs
3. Identify seven RESTful actions


## Notes

What is REST - a simple URL Convention by Roy Fielding.

It's a complex idea but it's easy to understand if we simplifiy it a bit.

Most of the web is about exposing data stored in applications.

(feel free to choose a more RESTful example for example domain)

http verbs mean something urls mean something

put it all together and we get predictable guessable urls that describe the things they are representing. we call these things a resource.

/posts vs /pictures

the 7 restful routes 7 restful actions

REST is a concept - not a technology. for right now, just think of it as standard URLS and HTTP verbs that describe what they are trying to do
