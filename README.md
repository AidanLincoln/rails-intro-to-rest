# Intro to REST

## Objectives

1. Define the RESTful URL conventions
2. Identify seven RESTful URLs and HTTP verbs
3. Identify seven RESTful actions


## Notes

They've seen rest in the sinatra case, but because HTML/CSS can only really do POST and GET we don't go into it super correctly. A reminder on what REST is and specifically the the routes that are created by default Rails.


Most of the web is about exposing data stored in applications.

(feel free to choose a more RESTful example for example domain)

http verbs mean something urls mean something

put it all together and we get predictable guessable urls that describe the things they are representing. we call these things a resource.

/posts vs /pictures

REST is a concept - not a technology. for right now, just think of it as standard URLS and HTTP verbs that describe what they are trying to do
